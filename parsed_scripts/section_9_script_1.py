### Script 1

The test script for the timer driver is as follows:

```python
import os
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
from shutil import copyfile

class TestTimerDriver(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.test_dir = TemporaryDirectory()
        self.coverage_files = ['vram\\\\EmulatorPkg\\\\Unix\\\\Host\\\\X11GraphicsWindow.c', 'vram\\\\EmulatorPkg\\\\PlatformSmbiosDxe\\\\PlatformSmbiosDxe.c', 'vram\\\\EmulatorPkg\\\\TimerDxe\\\\Timer.c']
        self.timer_driver_path = os.path.join(self.test_dir.name, 'TimerDxe')
        os.makedirs(self.timer_driver_path)

    def tearDown(self):
        self.test_dir.cleanup()

    def test_timer_driver_init(self):
        # Test that the timer driver can be initialized
        with patch('os.mkdir') as mock_mkdir:
            with patch('os.symlink') as mock_symlink:
                with open(os.path.join(self.timer_driver_path, 'Timer.c'), 'w') as f:
                    f.write('/* Timer driver implementation */')
                self.assertTrue(mock_mkdir.called)
                self.assertTrue(mock_symlink.called)

    def test_timer_driver_install(self):
        # Test that the timer driver can be installed
        with patch('os.mkdir') as mock_mkdir:
            with patch('os.symlink') as mock_symlink:
                with open(os.path.join(self.timer_driver_path, 'Timer.c'), 'w') as f:
                    f.write('/* Timer driver implementation */')
                self.assertTrue(mock_mkdir.called)
                self.assertTrue(mock_symlink.called)

    def test_timer_driver_edge_cases(self):
        # Test edge cases for the timer driver
        with patch('os.mkdir') as mock_mkdir:
            with patch('os.symlink') as mock_symlink:
                with open(os.path.join(self.timer_driver_path, 'Timer.c'), 'w') as f:
                    f.write('/* Timer driver implementation */')
                # Test that the timer driver can be initialized with an empty file
                with open(os.path.join(self.timer_driver_path, 'Timer.c'), 'w') as f:
                    f.write('')
                self.assertTrue(mock_mkdir.called)
                self.assertTrue(mock_symlink.called)

                # Test that the timer driver can be installed with an empty file
                with open(os.path.join(self.timer_driver_path, 'Timer.c'), 'w') as f:
                    f.write('')
                self.assertTrue(mock_mkdir.called)
                self.assertTrue(mock_symlink.called)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script uses the `unittest` framework to define test cases for the timer driver. The `setUp` method creates a temporary directory and sets up the test environment. The `tearDown` method cleans up the test environment after each test. The `test_timer_driver_init` and `test_timer_driver_install` methods test that the timer driver can be initialized and installed, respectively. The `test_timer_driver_edge_cases` method tests edge cases for the timer driver.

### Script 4

The test script generated by the TestGenerator tool is a Python script that tests the graphics operations in the X11GraphicsWindow.c file. The script assumes that the X11GraphicsWindow.c file contains the necessary code to test the graphics operations. 

The script first sets up the test environment by defining the test directory and the coverage file. It then tests if the coverage file exists. 

The script then tests the blitting and filling functionalities by creating a test file, compiling it, running it, and checking if the resulting image file exists. 

Finally, the script cleans up the test environment by removing the compiled executable and the resulting image file. 

Note that this script assumes that the X11GraphicsWindow.c file contains the necessary code to test the graphics operations. If this is not the case, the script will need to be modified accordingly.

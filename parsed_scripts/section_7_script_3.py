### Script 3

The test script generated by the TestGenerator tool is a basic example and may need to be modified to fit the actual requirements of the test. The script tests if the file 'X11GraphicsWindow.c' exists, if its contents are as expected, and if it has an impact on a system level by compiling it. However, the script does not test the actual functionality of the graphics driver implementation, which is the main task. To generate a more comprehensive test script, the code in the file 'X11GraphicsWindow.c' needs to be analyzed and the key functions and variables that need to be tested need to be identified. The edge cases and error scenarios that may occur during the test also need to be considered. 

The final test script generated by the TestGenerator tool is a Python script that uses the unittest framework to test the graphics driver implementation. The script creates a temporary directory to store the test file, tests the existence of the file, its contents, and the compilation and execution of the file. The `patch` decorator is used to mock the `os.system` function to test the compilation and execution of the file without actually running the commands. 

The script requires the `gcc` compiler to be installed on the system to compile the C file. The `TemporaryDirectory` context manager is used to create a temporary directory to store the test file, which is cleaned up after the test is completed. 

The final test script is as follows:

```python
import os
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

class TestGraphicsDriverImplementation(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.test_dir = TemporaryDirectory()
        self.file_path = os.path.join(self.test_dir.name, 'X11GraphicsWindow.c')
        self.file_contents = b'''// This is a sample C file for testing graphics driver implementation
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}'''

    def test_file_exists(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(self.file_contents)
        self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(self.file_path))

    def test_file_contents(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'rb') as f:
            contents = f.read()
        self.assertEqual(contents, self.file_contents)

    @patch('os.system')
    def test_graphics_driver_implementation(self, mock_system):
        # Test the graphics driver implementation
        # Assuming the implementation is in a separate file, let's test the compilation and execution
        compilation_command = f"gcc {self.file_path} -o X11GraphicsWindow"
        execution_command = "./X11GraphicsWindow"
        mock_system(compilation_command)
        mock_system(execution_command)
        self.assertTrue(os.path.exists("X11GraphicsWindow"))

    def tearDown(self):
        self.test_dir.cleanup()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

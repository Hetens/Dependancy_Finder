### Script 3

The test automation script for the EmuThunk task is as follows:

```python
import os
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from coverage import Coverage

class TestEmuThunk(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.coverage = Coverage()
        self.coverage.start()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.coverage.stop()
        self.coverage.save()

    @patch('builtins.open')
    def test_file_exists(self, mock_open):
        file_path = 'vram\\\\EmulatorPkg\\\\Unix\\\\Host\\\\EmuThunk.c'
        mock_open.return_value.__enter__.return_value.read.return_value = 'File contents not provided'
        self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(file_path))

    def test_file_contents(self):
        file_path = 'vram\\\\EmulatorPkg\\\\Unix\\\\Host\\\\EmuThunk.c'
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            contents = file.read()
            self.assertIn('File contents not provided', contents)

    def test_file_impact(self):
        # Assuming the file has a function that prints a message
        file_path = 'vram\\\\EmulatorPkg\\\\Unix\\\\Host\\\\EmuThunk.c'
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            contents = file.read()
            self.assertIn('printf', contents)

    def test_edge_cases(self):
        # Assuming the file has a function that handles edge cases
        file_path = 'vram\\\\EmulatorPkg\\\\Unix\\\\Host\\\\EmuThunk.c'
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            contents = file.read()
            self.assertIn('if (x > 10)', contents)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script assumes that the file `EmuThunk.c` exists in the specified path and contains the expected contents. It also assumes that the file has functions that print messages and handle edge cases.

The script uses the `unittest` framework to define test cases for the file's existence, contents, impact on the system, and edge cases. The `coverage` library is used to measure the code coverage of the tests.

Note that this script requires the `coverage` library to be installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install coverage`.

Also, this script assumes that the file `EmuThunk.c` is in the same directory as the script. If the file is in a different directory, you'll need to modify the `file_path` variable accordingly.

To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `test_emu_thunk.py`) and execute it using Python: `python test_emu_thunk.py`. The script will run the tests and report the results.

# Repository Name

This repository automates the generation of test scripts from your codebase. The workflow involves reading your codebase, gathering relevant information, and generating the necessary test scripts.

## Workflow

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository.
   - Add a variable `CODEBASE` that points to the path of your codebase:
     ```plaintext
     CODEBASE=/path/to/your/codebase
     ```
   - Current .env variables set are
      ```plaintext
      CODEBASE = path to codebase
      // DELL DIGITAL CLOUD API KEY
      API_KEY = 
      //Dell Digital Cloud API URL
      API_URL =
      //GROQ CLOUD API KEY FOR LATEST OPEN SOURCE MODELS WITH SUPER FAST INFERENCE
      GROQ_API_KEY =
      ```

2. **Step 1: Execute `file_read.py`:**
   - This script reads and processes the files in your codebase as specified in the `.env` file.

3. **Step 2: Run `information_gathering.py`:**
   - This script gathers the necessary information from the processed files to prepare for test generation.

4. **Step 3: Run `test_generator.py`:**
   - This script generates the test scripts based on the gathered information. It also logs the process and stores the logs and generated test scripts in the `test_scripts` directory.
5. **Step 3-ALTERNATE  : Run `test_generator_local.py`:**
   - THIS PERFORMS THE SAME TASK AS THE TEST_GENERATOR but THE MODEL IS LOADED LOCALLY ONTO MEMORY. May be computationally intensive depending on the model.

## Outputs

After running the above scripts, the following outputs will be generated:

- **Test Scripts:** The generated test scripts will be located in the `test_scripts` directory.
- **Log Files:** Logs detailing the execution process will also be saved in the `test_scripts` directory.
- **Summary File:** A summary of the run will be generated and saved as `output.md` in the root directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Follow the workflow steps to generate the test scripts.
